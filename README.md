Project Description -
This project utilizes Python code to conduct a sentiment analysis on the provided data. The analysis consists of two main components:
Raw Data Analysis: In the 'Raw_Data_Analysis' file, we perform basic data analysis, examining the shape of the data and determining the type of individual elements.
Data Preprocessing: The 'Data_Preprocess' file contains all data transformations, such as cleaning, filtering, and normalization. The results of the sentiment analysis are also stored in this file.
